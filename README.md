                                 //  --------------   MCQ Ans is here  ---------//

 1. let greeting;
    greetign = {};
    console.log(greetign);

                                        <!-- Answer to the Q 1 -->
  ## Ans: A: {}
  Explain: `let greeting;`: This line declares a variable named `greeting` but doesn't assign it a value. In JavaScript, when you declare a variable using `let` without assigning a value, it is initialized with the value undefined.
 `greeting = {};`: This line assigns an empty object `{}` to the variable `greeting`. Now, `greeting` holds an empty    object.
  `console.log(greeting);`: This line logs the value of the greeting variable to the console. In this case, the value of greeting is an empty object {}, and that's why you see `{}` in the console output. 


 2.function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
 }

 sum(1, "2");

                                  <!-- Answer to the Q 2 -->
## Ans: C: "12"
Explaine:JavaScript performs type coercion when you use the + operator with different data types. In this case, it converts the number 1 to a string and then performs string concatenation, not numerical addition.So when you add the number 1 and the string "2", JavaScript treats it as a concatenation operation, resulting in the string "12" because it joins the two values together as strings, not as numerical addition. 


3.const food = ["üçï", "üç´", "ü•ë", "üçî"];
const info = { favoriteFood: food[0] };

info.favoriteFood = "üçù";

console.log(food);

                                   <!-- Answer to the Q 3 -->
## Ans: A: ['üçï', 'üç´', 'ü•ë', 'üçî']
Explaine: when you log the food array to the console, it will display the original array, beacuse we changing the value of info.favoriteFood does not modify the original `food` array in any way.

4. function sayHi(name) {
  return `Hi there, ${name}`;
}

console.log(sayHi());
                                      <!-- Answer to the Q 4 -->
## Ans: B: Hi there, undefined;
Explaine: we have defined a function sayHi that takes a parameter name and returns a greeting message. However, when you call the sayHi function, you don't provide an argument for the name parameter. So we get the output is `Hi there, undefined;`


5.let count = 0;
const nums = [0, 1, 2, 3];

nums.forEach((num) => {
  if (num) count += 1;
});

console.log(count);
                                   
                                     <!-- Answer to the Q 5 -->
## Ans: C: 3;
Explaine: Now, let's analyze the elements of the nums array one by one within the forEach loop:

When num is 0, it's considered falsy, so it doesn't increment count.
When num is 1, 2, and 3, they are all truthy values, so for each of them, count is incremented by 1.
After the forEach loop completes, the count variable will have a value of 3 because it was incremented for the truthy values 1, 2, and 3 in the array. So The output will be 3 because that's the final value of the count variable after iterating through the nums array.
